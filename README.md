# feeder.py

This is micropython code for a BBC microbit used as part of a project to enable an
automated guinea pig feeder I made for a friend. The microbit activates a servo motor after a time set using the A
and B buttons. After the time has elapsed, the servo motor moves a lever 90 degrees.

This is used to open a lock on a box of food. This feeds the guinea pigs.

Details on how the servo motor is attached to the microbit can be found at:

Instructions on how to use the system and set the timer are here:
