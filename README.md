# feeder.py

This is micropython code for a BBC microbit as part of a project to enable an
automated guinea pig feeder, made for a friend. The servo motor activates after a time set using the A
and B buttons. After the time has elapsed, the servo motor moves a lever 90 degrees.

This is used to open a lock on a box of food. This feeds the guinea pigs.
